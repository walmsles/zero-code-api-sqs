# Serverless Integration, Zero Code

Recently I wrote my first AWS Community Builder article which you can read [here](https://dev.to/aws-builders/serverless-integration-zero-code-3i39).  It is a foray into the lambda-less server-less code-less world.

There is no code to be see here, no code frameworks, no technical solutions, just plain old API Gateway config using the Serveress Framework.

It was fun to write and explore this solution, I don't neccessarily promote use of this as a production ready use-case but it can be of use for anyone wanting to create native service integrations on AWS.
